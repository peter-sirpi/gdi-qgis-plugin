description=The plugin is designed to facilitate seamless discovery and access to data available on the GDI platform by leveraging its integrated APIs: the Data Explorer, Authorization Server, and OGC Resource Server. Through the Data Explorer API, users can efficiently search and locate the datasets relevant to their needs. The Authorization Server API ensures secure and controlled access, verifying user permissions and safeguarding data integrity. Finally, the OGC Resource Server API allows standardized access to geospatial data, enabling direct data retrieval in formats compatible with GIS and other data analysis tools. Together, these components empower users to easily find, access, and utilize the GDI platform's rich data resources for a wide range of applications.
